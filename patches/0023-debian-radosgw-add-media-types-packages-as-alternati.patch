Subject: [PATCH] debian: radosgw: add media-types packages as alternative for
 mime-support

Back in 2020 the '/etc/mime.types' file was split out into it's own
leaner 'media-types' Debian package [0], the previous 'mime-support'
was kept as transitional package to handle upgrades, but it did its
job and isn't included in Debian Trixie repos anymore.

So accept both, the new 'media-types' package or the legacy
'mime-support' one as valid dependency for radosgw, this ensures one
can install radosgw on newer Debian based releases while keeping it
also working for older ones.
