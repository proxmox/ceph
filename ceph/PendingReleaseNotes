15.2.16
-------

* A health warning will now be reported if the ``require-osd-release`` flag is not
  set to the appropriate release after a cluster upgrade.

15.2.14
-------

* RGW: It is possible to specify ssl options and ciphers for beast frontend now.
  The default ssl options setting is "no_sslv2:no_sslv3:no_tlsv1:no_tlsv1_1".
  If you want to return back the old behavior add 'ssl_options=' (empty) to
  ``rgw frontends`` configuration.

15.2.11
-------

* `ceph-mgr-modules-core` debian package does not recommend `ceph-mgr-rook`
  anymore. As the latter depends on `python3-numpy` which cannot be imported in
  different Python sub-interpreters multi-times if the version of
  `python3-numpy` is older than 1.19. Since `apt-get` installs the `Recommends`
  packages by default, `ceph-mgr-rook` was always installed along with
  `ceph-mgr` debian package as an indirect dependency. If your workflow depends
  on this behavior, you might want to install `ceph-mgr-rook` separately.

* OSD: the option ``osd_fast_shutdown_notify_mon`` has been introduced to allow
  the OSD to notify the monitor it is shutting down even if ``osd_fast_shutdown``
  is enabled. This helps with the monitor logs on larger clusters, that may get
  many 'osd.X reported immediately failed by osd.Y' messages, and confuse tools.

* An AWS-compliant API: "GetTopicAttributes" was added to replace the existing "GetTopic" API. The new API
  should be used to fetch information about topics used for bucket notifications.
