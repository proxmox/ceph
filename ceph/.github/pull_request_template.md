<!--
Thank you for opening a pull request!  Here are some tips on creating
a well formatted contribution.

Please give your pull request a title like "[component]: [short description]"

This is the format for commit messages:

"""
[component]: [short description]

[A longer multiline description]

Fixes: [ticket URL on tracker.ceph.com, create one if necessary]
Signed-off-by: [Your Name] <[your email]>
"""

The Signed-off-by line is important, and it is your certification that
your contributions satisfy the Developers Certificate or Origin.  For
more detail, see SubmittingPatches.rst.

The component is the short name of a major daemon or subsystem,
something like "mon", "osd", "mds", "rbd, "rgw", etc. For ceph-mgr modules,
give the component as "mgr/<module name>" rather than a path into pybind.

For more examples, simply use "git log" and look at some historical commits.

This was just a quick overview.  More information for contributors is available here:
