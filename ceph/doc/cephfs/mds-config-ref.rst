 MDS Config Reference
======================

``mds_cache_memory_limit``

:Description: The memory limit the MDS should enforce for its cache.
:Type:  64-bit Integer Unsigned
:Default: ``4G``

``mds_cache_reservation``

:Description: The cache reservation (memory or inodes) for the MDS cache to maintain.
              Once the MDS begins dipping into its reservation, it will recall
              client state until its cache size shrinks to restore the
              reservation.

              blocklisted when the administrator blocklists it manually. For
