Testing - unit tests
====================

Ceph has two types of tests: unit tests (also called :ref:`make
check<make-check>` tests) and integration tests. Strictly speaking, the
:ref:`make check<make-check>` tests are not "unit tests", but rather tests that
can be run easily on a single build machine after compiling Ceph from source,
whereas integration tests require packages and multi-machine clusters to run.

.. _make-check:

What does "make check" mean?
----------------------------

After compiling Ceph, the code can be run through a battery of tests covering
various aspects of Ceph. For historical reasons, this battery of tests is
often referred to as :ref:`make check<make-check>` even though the actual command used to run
the tests is now ``ctest``. For inclusion in this battery of tests, a test
must:

* bind ports that do not conflict with other tests
* not require root access
* not require more than one machine to run
* complete within a few minutes

For simplicity, we will refer to this class of tests as "make check tests" or
"unit tests", to distinguish them from the more complex "integration tests"
that are run via the `teuthology framework`_.

While it is possible to run ``ctest`` directly, it can be tricky to correctly
set up your environment. Fortunately, a script is provided to make it easier
run the unit tests on your code. It can be run from the top-level directory of
the Ceph source tree by doing::

    $ ./run-make-check.sh


You will need a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 32GB of free disk space for this
command to complete successfully on x86_64 (other architectures may have
different constraints). Depending on your hardware, it can take from 20
minutes to three hours to complete, but it's worth the wait.

How unit tests are declared
---------------------------

Unit tests are declared in the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files (multiple files under
``./src``) using the ``add_ceph_test`` or ``add_ceph_unittest`` CMake
functions, which are themselves defined in
``./cmake/modules/AddCephTest.cmake``. Some unit tests are scripts, while
others are binaries that are compiled during the build process.  The
``add_ceph_test`` function is used to declare unit test scripts, while
``add_ceph_unittest`` is used for unit test binaries.

Unit testing of CLI tools
-------------------------

Some of the CLI tools are tested using special files ending with the extension
``.t`` and stored under ``./src/test/cli``. These tests are run using a tool
called `cram`_ via a shell script ``./src/test/run-cli-tests``.  `cram`_ tests
that are not suitable for :ref:`make check<make-check>` may also be run by
teuthology using the `cram task`_.

Tox based testing of python modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most python modules can be found under ``./src/pybind/``.

Many modules use **tox** to run their unit tests.
**tox** itself is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool.

To find out quickly if tox can be run you can either just try to run ``tox``
or find out if a ``tox.ini`` exists.

Currently the following modules use tox:

- Cephadm (``./src/pybind/mgr/cephadm``)
- Insights (``./src/pybind/mgr/insights``)
- Manager core (``./src/pybind/mgr``)
- Dashboard (``./src/pybind/mgr/dashboard``)
- Python common (``./src/python-common/tox.ini``)


Most tox configuration support multiple environments and tasks. You can see
which environments and tasks are supported by looking into the ``tox.ini``
file to see what ``envlist`` is assigned.
To run **tox**, just execute ``tox`` in the directory where ``tox.ini`` lies.
Without any specified environments ``-e $env1,$env2``, all environments will
be run. Jenkins will run ``tox`` by executing ``run_tox.sh`` which lies under
``./src/script``.

Here some examples from ceph dashboard on how to specify different
environments and run options::

  ## Run Python 2+3 tests+lint commands:
  $ tox -e py27,py3,lint,check

  ## Run Python 3 tests+lint commands:
  $ tox -e py3,lint,check

  ## To run it like Jenkins would do
  $ ../../../script/run_tox.sh --tox-env py27,py3,lint,check
  $ ../../../script/run_tox.sh --tox-env py3,lint,check

Manager core unit tests
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Currently only doctests_ inside ``mgr_util.py`` are run.

To add more files that should be tested inside the core of the manager add
them at the end of the line that includes ``mgr_util.py`` inside ``tox.ini``.

Unit test caveats
-----------------

1. Unlike the various Ceph daemons and ``ceph-fuse``, the unit tests
   are linked against the default memory allocator (glibc) unless explicitly
   linked against something else. This enables tools like valgrind to be used
   in the tests.
