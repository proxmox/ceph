 Governance
============

The Ceph open source community is guided by a few different groups.

Key principles
==============

 * Decision-making is consensus-driven by those who participate.
 * Leadership roles are defined primarily by responsibility, not prestige or seniority.
 * It is normal and healthy for these roles to be passed on to others
 * Everyone's role is ultimately to serve the users and participation
   is voluntary.

Bodies
