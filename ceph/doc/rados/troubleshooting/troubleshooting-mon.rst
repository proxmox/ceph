 Troubleshooting Monitors
==========================

.. index:: monitor, high availability

If a cluster encounters monitor-related problems, this does not necessarily
mean that the cluster is in danger of going down. Even if multiple monitors are
lost, the cluster can still be up and running, as long as there are enough
surviving monitors to form a quorum.

However serious your cluster's monitor-related problems might be, we recommend
that you take the following troubleshooting steps.


Initial Troubleshooting
=======================

**Are the monitors running?**

  First, make sure that the monitor (*mon*) daemon processes (``ceph-mon``) are
  running. Sometimes Ceph admins either forget to start the mons or forget to
  restart the mons after an upgrade. Checking for this simple oversight can
  save hours of painstaking troubleshooting. It is also important to make sure
  that the manager daemons (``ceph-mgr``) are running. Remember that typical
  cluster configurations provide one ``ceph-mgr`` for each ``ceph-mon``.

  .. note:: Rook will not run more than two managers.

**Can you reach the monitor nodes?**

  In certain rare cases, there may be ``iptables`` rules that block access to
  monitor nodes or TCP ports. These rules might be left over from earlier
  stress testing or rule development. To check for the presence of such rules,
  SSH into the server and then try to connect to the monitor's ports
  (``tcp/3300`` and ``tcp/6789``) using ``telnet``, ``nc``, or a similar tool.

**Does the ``ceph status`` command run and receive a reply from the cluster?**

  If the ``ceph status`` command does receive a reply from the cluster, then the
  cluster is up and running. The monitors will answer to a ``status`` request
  only if there is a formed quorum. Confirm that one or more ``mgr`` daemons
  are reported as running. Under ideal conditions, all ``mgr`` daemons will be
  reported as running.


  If the ``ceph status`` command does not receive a reply from the cluster, then
  there are probably not enough monitors ``up`` to form a quorum.  The ``ceph
  -s`` command with no further options specified connects to an arbitrarily
  selected monitor. In certain cases, however, it might be helpful to connect
  to a specific monitor (or to several specific monitors in sequence) by adding
  the ``-m`` flag to the command: for example, ``ceph status -m mymon1``.


**None of this worked. What now?**

  If the above solutions have not resolved your problems, you might find it
  helpful to examine each individual monitor in turn. Whether or not a quorum
  has been formed, it is possible to contact each monitor individually and
  request its status by using the ``ceph tell mon.ID mon_status`` command (here
  ``ID`` is the monitor's identifier).

  Run the ``ceph tell mon.ID mon_status`` command for each monitor in the
  cluster. For more on this command's output, see :ref:`Understanding
  mon_status
  <rados_troubleshoting_troubleshooting_mon_understanding_mon_status>`.

  There is also an alternative method: SSH into each monitor node and query the
  daemon's admin socket. See :ref:`Using the Monitor's Admin
  Socket<rados_troubleshoting_troubleshooting_mon_using_admin_socket>`.

.. _rados_troubleshoting_troubleshooting_mon_using_admin_socket:

Using the monitor's admin socket
================================

A monitor's admin socket allows you to interact directly with a specific daemon
by using a Unix socket file. This file is found in the monitor's ``run``
directory. The admin socket's default directory is
``/var/run/ceph/ceph-mon.ID.asok``, but this can be overridden and the admin
socket might be elsewhere, especially if your cluster's daemons are deployed in
containers. If you cannot find it, either check your ``ceph.conf`` for an
alternative path or run the following command:
    
.. prompt:: bash $

   ceph-conf --name mon.ID --show-config-value admin_socket

The admin socket is available for use only when the monitor daemon is running.
Whenever the monitor has been properly shut down, the admin socket is removed.
However, if the monitor is not running and the admin socket persists, it is
likely that the monitor has been improperly shut down.  In any case, if the
monitor is not running, it will be impossible to use the admin socket, and the
``ceph`` command is likely to return ``Error 111: Connection Refused``.

To access the admin socket, run a ``ceph tell`` command of the following form
(specifying the daemon that you are interested in):

.. prompt:: bash $

   ceph tell mon.<id> mon_status

This command passes a ``help`` command to the specific running monitor daemon
``<id>`` via its admin socket. If you know the full path to the admin socket
file, this can be done more directly by running the following command:

.. prompt:: bash $

   ceph --admin-daemon <full_path_to_asok_file> <command>

Running ``ceph help`` shows all supported commands that are available through
the admin socket. See especially ``config get``, ``config show``, ``mon stat``,
and ``quorum_status``.

.. _rados_troubleshoting_troubleshooting_mon_understanding_mon_status:

Understanding mon_status
========================

The status of the monitor (as reported by the ``ceph tell mon.X mon_status``
command) can always be obtained via the admin socket. This command outputs a
great deal of information about the monitor (including the information found in
the output of the ``quorum_status`` command).

To understand this command's output, let us consider the following example, in
which we see the output of ``ceph tell mon.c mon_status``::

  { "name": "c",
    "rank": 2,
    "state": "peon",
    "election_epoch": 38,
    "quorum": [
          1,
          2],
    "outside_quorum": [],
    "extra_probe_peers": [],
    "sync_provider": [],
    "monmap": { "epoch": 3,
        "fsid": "5c4e9d53-e2e1-478a-8061-f543f8be4cf8",
        "modified": "2013-10-30 04:12:01.945629",
        "created": "2013-10-29 14:14:41.914786",
        "mons": [
              { "rank": 0,
                "name": "a",
                "addr": "127.0.0.1:6789\/0"},
              { "rank": 1,
                "name": "b",
                "addr": "127.0.0.1:6790\/0"},
              { "rank": 2,
                "name": "c",
                "addr": "127.0.0.1:6795\/0"}]}}

It is clear that there are three monitors in the monmap (*a*, *b*, and *c*),
the quorum is formed by only two monitors, and *c* is in the quorum as a
*peon*.

**Which monitor is out of the quorum?**

  The answer is **a** (that is, ``mon.a``).

**Why?**

  When the ``quorum`` set is examined, there are clearly two monitors in the
  set: *1* and *2*. But these are not monitor names. They are monitor ranks, as
  established in the current ``monmap``. The ``quorum`` set does not include
  the monitor that has rank 0, and according to the ``monmap`` that monitor is
  ``mon.a``.

**How are monitor ranks determined?**

  Monitor ranks are calculated (or recalculated) whenever monitors are added or
  removed. The calculation of ranks follows a simple rule: the **greater** the
  ``IP:PORT`` combination, the **lower** the rank. In this case, because
  ``127.0.0.1:6789`` is lower than the other two ``IP:PORT`` combinations,
  ``mon.a`` has the highest rank: namely, rank 0.
  

Most Common Monitor Issues
===========================

Have Quorum but at least one Monitor is down
---------------------------------------------

When this happens, depending on the version of Ceph you are running,
you should be seeing something similar to::

      $ ceph health detail
      [snip]
      mon.a (rank 0) addr 127.0.0.1:6789/0 is down (out of quorum)

How to troubleshoot this?

  First, make sure ``mon.a`` is running.

  Second, make sure you are able to connect to ``mon.a``'s node from the
  other mon nodes. Check the TCP ports as well. Check ``iptables`` and
  ``nf_conntrack`` on all nodes and ensure that you are not
  dropping/rejecting connections.

  If this initial troubleshooting doesn't solve your problems, then it's
  time to go deeper.

  First, check the problematic monitor's ``mon_status`` via the admin
  socket as explained in `Using the monitor's admin socket`_ and
  `Understanding mon_status`_.

  If the monitor is out of the quorum, its state should be one of ``probing``,
  ``electing`` or ``synchronizing``. If it happens to be either ``leader`` or
  ``peon``, then the monitor believes to be in quorum, while the remaining
  cluster is sure it is not; or maybe it got into the quorum while we were
  troubleshooting the monitor, so check you ``ceph status`` again just to make
  sure. Proceed if the monitor is not yet in the quorum.

What if the state is ``probing``?

  This means the monitor is still looking for the other monitors. Every time
  you start a monitor, the monitor will stay in this state for some time while
  trying to connect the rest of the monitors specified in the ``monmap``.  The
  time a monitor will spend in this state can vary. For instance, when on a
  single-monitor cluster (never do this in production), the monitor will pass
  through the probing state almost instantaneously.  In a multi-monitor
  cluster, the monitors will stay in this state until they find enough monitors
  to form a quorum |---| this means that if you have 2 out of 3 monitors down, the
  one remaining monitor will stay in this state indefinitely until you bring
  one of the other monitors up.

  If you have a quorum the starting daemon should be able to find the
  other monitors quickly, as long as they can be reached. If your
  monitor is stuck probing and you have gone through with all the communication
  troubleshooting, then there is a fair chance that the monitor is trying
  to reach the other monitors on a wrong address. ``mon_status`` outputs the
  ``monmap`` known to the monitor: check if the other monitor's locations
  match reality. If they don't, jump to
  `Recovering a Monitor's Broken monmap`_; if they do, then it may be related
  to severe clock skews amongst the monitor nodes and you should refer to
  `Clock Skews`_ first, but if that doesn't solve your problem then it is
  the time to prepare some logs and reach out to the community (please refer
  to `Preparing your logs`_ on how to best prepare your logs).


What if state is ``electing``?

  This means the monitor is in the middle of an election. With recent Ceph
  releases these typically complete quickly, but at times the monitors can
  get stuck in what is known as an *election storm*. This can indicate
  clock skew among the monitor nodes; jump to
  `Clock Skews`_ for more information. If all your clocks are properly
  synchronized, you should search the mailing lists and tracker.
  This is not a state that is likely to persist and aside from
  (*really*) old bugs there is not an obvious reason besides clock skews on
  why this would happen.  Worst case, if there are enough surviving mons,
  down the problematic one while you investigate.

What if state is ``synchronizing``?

  This means the monitor is catching up with the rest of the cluster in
  order to join the quorum. Time to synchronize is a function of the size
  of your monitor store and thus of cluster size and state, so if you have a
  large or degraded cluster this may take a while.

  If you notice that the monitor jumps from ``synchronizing`` to
  ``electing`` and then back to ``synchronizing``, then you do have a
  problem: the cluster state may be advancing (i.e., generating new maps)
  too fast for the synchronization process to keep up. This was a more common
  thing in early days (Cuttlefish), but since then the synchronization process
  has been refactored and enhanced to avoid this dynamic. If you experience
  this in later versions please let us know via a bug tracker. And bring some logs
  (see `Preparing your logs`_).

What if state is ``leader`` or ``peon``?

  This should not happen:  famous last words.  If it does, however, it likely
  has a lot to do with clock skew -- see `Clock Skews`_. If you are not
  suffering from clock skew, then please prepare your logs (see
  `Preparing your logs`_) and reach out to the community.


Recovering a Monitor's Broken ``monmap``
----------------------------------------

This is how a ``monmap`` usually looks, depending on the number of
monitors::


      epoch 3
      fsid 5c4e9d53-e2e1-478a-8061-f543f8be4cf8
      last_changed 2013-10-30 04:12:01.945629
      created 2013-10-29 14:14:41.914786
      0: 127.0.0.1:6789/0 mon.a
      1: 127.0.0.1:6790/0 mon.b
      2: 127.0.0.1:6795/0 mon.c
      
This may not be what you have however. For instance, in some versions of
early Cuttlefish there was a bug that could cause your ``monmap``
to be nullified.  Completely filled with zeros. This means that not even
``monmaptool`` would be able to make sense of cold, hard, inscrutable zeros.
It's also possible to end up with a monitor with a severely outdated monmap,
notably if the node has been down for months while you fight with your vendor's
TAC.  The subject ``ceph-mon`` daemon might be unable to find the surviving
monitors (e.g., say ``mon.c`` is down; you add a new monitor ``mon.d``,
then remove ``mon.a``, then add a new monitor ``mon.e`` and remove
``mon.b``; you will end up with a totally different monmap from the one
``mon.c`` knows).

In this situation you have two possible solutions:

Scrap the monitor and redeploy

  You should only take this route if you are positive that you won't
  lose the information kept by that monitor; that you have other monitors
  and that they are running just fine so that your new monitor is able
  to synchronize from the remaining monitors. Keep in mind that destroying
  a monitor, if there are no other copies of its contents, may lead to
  loss of data.

Inject a monmap into the monitor

  These are the basic steps:

  Retrieve the ``monmap`` from the surviving monitors and inject it into the
  monitor whose ``monmap`` is corrupted or lost.

  Implement this solution by carrying out the following procedure:

  1. Is there a quorum of monitors? If so, retrieve the ``monmap`` from the
     quorum::

      $ ceph mon getmap -o /tmp/monmap

  2. If there is no quorum, then retrieve the ``monmap`` directly from another
     monitor that has been stopped (in this example, the other monitor has
     the ID ``ID-FOO``)::

      $ ceph-mon -i ID-FOO --extract-monmap /tmp/monmap

  3. Stop the monitor you are going to inject the monmap into.

  4. Inject the monmap::

      $ ceph-mon -i ID --inject-monmap /tmp/monmap

  5. Start the monitor

  .. warning:: Injecting ``monmaps`` can cause serious problems because doing
     so will overwrite the latest existing ``monmap`` stored on the monitor. Be
     careful!

Clock Skews
-----------

The Paxos consensus algorithm requires tight time alignment. For this reason,
clock skew among the monitors in the quorum can have a serious effect on
monitor operation. The resulting behavior can be very puzzling. To avoid
this kind of issue, run a clock synchronization tool on your monitor nodes:
for example, ``Chrony`` or the legacy ``ntpd`` utility. Be sure to configure
the monitor nodes with the `iburst` option and multiple peers:

* Each other
* Internal ``NTP`` servers
* Multiple external, public pool servers

.. note:: The ``iburst`` option sends a burst of eight packets instead of the
   usual single packet, and is used during the process of getting two peers
   into initial synchronization.

Furthermore, it is advisable to synchronize *all* nodes in your cluster against
internal and external servers, and perhaps even against your monitors. ``NTP``
servers should run on bare metal; VM virtualized clocks are not suitable for
steady timekeeping. For more information, visit `https://www.ntp.org
<https://www.ntp.org>`_.  Your organization might already have quality internal
``NTP`` servers available.  Sources for ``NTP`` server appliances include the
following:

* Microsemi (formerly Symmetricom) `https://microsemi.com <https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/3425-timing-synchronization>`_
* EndRun `https://endruntechnologies.com <https://endruntechnologies.com/products/ntp-time-servers>`_
* Netburner `https://www.netburner.com <https://www.netburner.com/products/network-time-server/pk70-ex-ntp-network-time-server>`_

What's the maximum tolerated clock skew?

  By default, monitors allow clocks to drift up to a maximum of 0.05 seconds
  (50 milliseconds).

Can I increase the maximum tolerated clock skew?

  Yes, but we strongly recommend against doing so. The maximum tolerated clock
  skew is configurable via the ``mon-clock-drift-allowed`` option, but it is
  almost certainly a bad idea to make changes to this option. The clock skew
  maximum is in place because clock-skewed monitors cannot be relied upon. The
  current default value has proven its worth at alerting the user before the
  monitors encounter serious problems. Changing this value might cause
  unforeseen effects on the stability of the monitors and overall cluster
  health.

How do I know whether there is a clock skew?

  The monitors will warn you via the cluster status ``HEALTH_WARN``. When clock
  skew is present, the ``ceph health detail`` and ``ceph status`` commands
  return an output resembling the following::

      mon.c addr 10.10.0.1:6789/0 clock skew 0.08235s > max 0.05s (latency 0.0045s)

  In this example, the monitor ``mon.c`` has been flagged as suffering from 
  clock skew.

  In Luminous and later releases, it is possible to check for a clock skew by
  running the ``ceph time-sync-status`` command. Note that the lead monitor
  typically has the numerically lowest IP address. It will always show ``0``:
  the reported offsets of other monitors are relative to the lead monitor, not
  to any external reference source.

What should I do if there is a clock skew?

  Synchronize your clocks. Using an NTP client might help. However, if you
  are already using an NTP client and you still encounter clock skew problems,
  determine whether the NTP server that you are using is remote to your network
  or instead hosted on your network. Hosting your own NTP servers tends to
  mitigate clock skew problems.


Client Can't Connect or Mount
-----------------------------

Check your IP tables. Some operating-system install utilities add a ``REJECT``
rule to ``iptables``. ``iptables`` rules will reject all clients other than
``ssh`` that try to connect to the host. If your monitor host's IP tables have
a ``REJECT`` rule in place, clients that are connecting from a separate node
will fail and will raise a timeout error. Any ``iptables`` rules that reject
clients trying to connect to Ceph daemons must be addressed. For example::

    REJECT all -- anywhere anywhere reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

It might also be necessary to add rules to iptables on your Ceph hosts to
ensure that clients are able to access the TCP ports associated with your Ceph
monitors (default: port 6789) and Ceph OSDs (default: 6800 through 7300). For
example::

    iptables -A INPUT -m multiport -p tcp -s {ip-address}/{netmask} --dports 6789,6800:7300 -j ACCEPT


Monitor Store Failures
======================

Symptoms of store corruption
----------------------------

Ceph monitors store the :term:`Cluster Map` in a key-value store.  If key-value
store corruption causes a monitor to fail, then the monitor log might contain
one of the following error messages::

  Corruption: error in middle of record

or::

  Corruption: 1 missing files; e.g.: /var/lib/ceph/mon/mon.foo/store.db/1234567.ldb

Recovery using healthy monitor(s)
---------------------------------

If there are surviving monitors, we can always :ref:`replace
<adding-and-removing-monitors>` the corrupted monitor with a new one. After the
new monitor boots, it will synchronize with a healthy peer. After the new
monitor is fully synchronized, it will be able to serve clients.

.. _mon-store-recovery-using-osds:

Recovery using OSDs
-------------------

Even if all monitors fail at the same time, it is possible to recover the
monitor store by using information stored in OSDs. You are encouraged to deploy
at least three (and preferably five) monitors in a Ceph cluster. In such a
deployment, complete monitor failure is unlikely. However, unplanned power loss
in a data center whose disk settings or filesystem settings are improperly
configured could cause the underlying filesystem to fail and this could kill
all of the monitors. In such a case, data in the OSDs can be used to recover
the monitors.  The following is such a script and can be used to recover the
monitors:


.. code-block:: bash

  ms=/root/mon-store
  mkdir $ms
  
  # collect the cluster map from stopped OSDs
  for host in $hosts; do
    rsync -avz $ms/. user@$host:$ms.remote
    rm -rf $ms
    ssh user@$host <<EOF
      for osd in /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-*; do
        ceph-objectstore-tool --data-path \$osd --no-mon-config --op update-mon-db --mon-store-path $ms.remote
      done
  EOF
    rsync -avz user@$host:$ms.remote/. $ms
  done
  
  # rebuild the monitor store from the collected map, if the cluster does not
  # use cephx authentication, we can skip the following steps to update the
  # keyring with the caps, and there is no need to pass the "--keyring" option.
  # i.e. just use "ceph-monstore-tool $ms rebuild" instead
  ceph-authtool /path/to/admin.keyring -n mon. \
    --cap mon 'allow *'
  ceph-authtool /path/to/admin.keyring -n client.admin \
    --cap mon 'allow *' --cap osd 'allow *' --cap mds 'allow *'
  # add one or more ceph-mgr's key to the keyring. in this case, an encoded key
  # for mgr.x is added, you can find the encoded key in
  # /etc/ceph/${cluster}.${mgr_name}.keyring on the machine where ceph-mgr is
  # deployed
  ceph-authtool /path/to/admin.keyring --add-key 'AQDN8kBe9PLWARAAZwxXMr+n85SBYbSlLcZnMA==' -n mgr.x \
    --cap mon 'allow profile mgr' --cap osd 'allow *' --cap mds 'allow *'
  # If your monitors' ids are not sorted by ip address, please specify them in order.
  # For example. if mon 'a' is 10.0.0.3, mon 'b' is 10.0.0.2, and mon 'c' is  10.0.0.4,
  # please passing "--mon-ids b a c".
  # In addition, if your monitors' ids are not single characters like 'a', 'b', 'c', please
  # specify them in the command line by passing them as arguments of the "--mon-ids"
  # option. if you are not sure, please check your ceph.conf to see if there is any
  # sections named like '[mon.foo]'. don't pass the "--mon-ids" option, if you are
  # using DNS SRV for looking up monitors.
  ceph-monstore-tool $ms rebuild -- --keyring /path/to/admin.keyring --mon-ids alpha beta gamma
  
  # make a backup of the corrupted store.db just in case!  repeat for
  # all monitors.
  mv /var/lib/ceph/mon/mon.foo/store.db /var/lib/ceph/mon/mon.foo/store.db.corrupted

  # move rebuild store.db into place.  repeat for all monitors.
  mv $ms/store.db /var/lib/ceph/mon/mon.foo/store.db
  chown -R ceph:ceph /var/lib/ceph/mon/mon.foo/store.db

This script performs the following steps:

#. Collects the map from each OSD host.
#. Rebuilds the store.
#. Fills the entities in the keyring file with appropriate capabilities.
#. Replaces the corrupted store on ``mon.foo`` with the recovered copy.


Known limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The above recovery tool is unable to recover the following information:

- **Certain added keyrings**: All of the OSD keyrings added using the ``ceph
  auth add`` command are recovered from the OSD's copy, and the
  ``client.admin`` keyring is imported using ``ceph-monstore-tool``. However,
  the MDS keyrings and all other keyrings will be missing in the recovered
  monitor store. You might need to manually re-add them.

- **Creating pools**: If any RADOS pools were in the process of being created,
  that state is lost. The recovery tool operates on the assumption that all
  pools have already been created. If there are PGs that are stuck in the
  'unknown' state after the recovery for a partially created pool, you can
  force creation of the *empty* PG by running the ``ceph osd force-create-pg``
  command. Note that this will create an *empty* PG, so take this action only
  if you know the pool is empty.

- **MDS Maps**: The MDS maps are lost.


Everything Failed! Now What?
============================

Reaching out for help
---------------------

You can find help on IRC in #ceph and #ceph-devel on OFTC (server
irc.oftc.net), or at ``dev@ceph.io`` and ``ceph-users@lists.ceph.com``. Make
sure that you have prepared your logs and that you have them ready upon
request.

See https://ceph.io/en/community/connect/ for current (as of October 2023)
information on getting in contact with the upstream Ceph community.


Preparing your logs
-------------------

The default location for monitor logs is ``/var/log/ceph/ceph-mon.FOO.log*``.
However, if they are not there, you can find their current location by running
the following command:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph-conf --name mon.FOO --show-config-value log_file

The amount of information in the logs is determined by the debug levels in the
cluster's configuration files. If Ceph is using the default debug levels, then
your logs might be missing important information that would help the upstream
Ceph community address your issue.

To make sure your monitor logs contain relevant information, you can raise
debug levels. Here we are interested in information from the monitors.  As with
other components, the monitors have different parts that output their debug
information on different subsystems.

If you are an experienced Ceph troubleshooter, we recommend raising the debug
levels of the most relevant subsystems. Of course, this approach might not be
easy for beginners. In most cases, however, enough information to address the
issue will be secured if the following debug levels are entered::

      debug mon = 10
      debug ms = 1

Sometimes these debug levels do not yield enough information. In such cases,
members of the upstream Ceph community might ask you to make additional changes
to these or to other debug levels. In any case, it is better for us to receive
at least some useful information than to receive an empty log.


Do I need to restart a monitor to adjust debug levels?
------------------------------------------------------

No, restarting a monitor is not necessary. Debug levels may be adjusted by
using two different methods, depending on whether or not there is a quorum:

There is a quorum

  Either inject the debug option into the specific monitor that needs to 
  be debugged::

        ceph tell mon.FOO config set debug_mon 10/10

  Or inject it into all monitors at once::

        ceph tell mon.* config set debug_mon 10/10


There is no quorum

  Use the admin socket of the specific monitor that needs to be debugged
  and directly adjust the monitor's configuration options::

      ceph daemon mon.FOO config set debug_mon 10/10


To return the debug levels to their default values, run the above commands
using the debug level ``1/10`` rather than ``10/10``. To check a monitor's
current values, use the admin socket and run either of the following commands:

  .. prompt:: bash

     ceph daemon mon.FOO config show

or:

  .. prompt:: bash

     ceph daemon mon.FOO config get 'OPTION_NAME'



I Reproduced the problem with appropriate debug levels. Now what?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We prefer that you send us only the portions of your logs that are relevant to
your monitor problems. Of course, it might not be easy for you to determine
which portions are relevant so we are willing to accept complete and
unabridged logs. However, we request that you avoid sending logs containing
hundreds of thousands of lines with no additional clarifying information. One
common-sense way of making our task easier is to write down the current time
and date when you are reproducing the problem and then extract portions of your
logs based on that information.

Finally, reach out to us on the mailing lists or IRC or Slack, or by filing a
new issue on the `tracker`_.
