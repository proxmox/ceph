=======
 Pools
=======
Pools are logical partitions for storing objects.

When you first deploy a cluster without creating a pool, Ceph uses the default
pools for storing data. A pool provides you with:

- **Resilience**: You can set how many OSD are allowed to fail without losing data.
  For replicated pools, it is the desired number of copies/replicas of an object.
  A typical configuration stores an object and one additional copy
  (i.e., ``size = 2``), but you can determine the number of copies/replicas.
  For `erasure coded pools <../erasure-code>`_, it is the number of coding chunks
  (i.e. ``m=2`` in the **erasure code profile**)

- **Placement Groups**: You can set the number of placement groups for the pool.
  A typical configuration uses approximately 100 placement groups per OSD to
  provide optimal balancing without using up too many computing resources. When
  setting up multiple pools, be careful to ensure you set a reasonable number of
  placement groups for both the pool and the cluster as a whole.

- **CRUSH Rules**: When you store data in a pool, placement of the object
  and its replicas (or chunks for erasure coded pools) in your cluster is governed
  by CRUSH rules. You can create a custom CRUSH rule for your pool if the default
  rule is not appropriate for your use case.

- **Snapshots**: When you create snapshots with ``ceph osd pool mksnap``,
  you effectively take a snapshot of a particular pool.

To organize data into pools, you can list, create, and remove pools.
You can also view the utilization statistics for each pool.

List Pools
==========

To list your cluster's pools, execute::

	ceph osd lspools


.. _createpool:

Create a Pool
=============

Before creating pools, refer to the `Pool, PG and CRUSH Config Reference`_.
Ideally, you should override the default value for the number of placement
groups in your Ceph configuration file, as the default is NOT ideal.
For details on placement group numbers refer to `setting the number of placement groups`_

.. note:: Starting with Luminous, all pools need to be associated to the
   application using the pool. See `Associate Pool to Application`_ below for
   more information.

For example::

	osd pool default pg num = 100
	osd pool default pgp num = 100

To create a pool, execute::

	ceph osd pool create {pool-name} [{pg-num} [{pgp-num}]] [replicated] \
             [crush-rule-name] [expected-num-objects]
	ceph osd pool create {pool-name} [{pg-num} [{pgp-num}]]   erasure \
             [erasure-code-profile] [crush-rule-name] [expected_num_objects] [--autoscale-mode=<on,off,warn>]

Where:

``{pool-name}``

:Description: The name of the pool. It must be unique.
:Type: String
:Required: Yes.

``{pg-num}``

:Description: The total number of placement groups for the pool. See `Placement
              Groups`_  for details on calculating a suitable number. The
              default value ``8`` is NOT suitable for most systems.

:Type: Integer
:Required: Yes.
:Default: 8

``{pgp-num}``

:Description: The total number of placement groups for placement purposes. This
              **should be equal to the total number of placement groups**, except
              for placement group splitting scenarios.

:Type: Integer
:Required: Yes. Picks up default or Ceph configuration value if not specified.
:Default: 8

``{replicated|erasure}``

:Description: The pool type which may either be **replicated** to
              recover from lost OSDs by keeping multiple copies of the
              objects or **erasure** to get a kind of
              `generalized RAID5 <../erasure-code>`_ capability.
              The **replicated** pools require more
              raw storage but implement all Ceph operations. The
              **erasure** pools require less raw storage but only
              implement a subset of the available operations.

:Type: String
:Required: No.
:Default: replicated

``[crush-rule-name]``

:Description: The name of a CRUSH rule to use for this pool.  The specified
              rule must exist.

:Type: String
:Required: No.
:Default: For **replicated** pools it is the rule specified by the ``osd
          pool default crush rule`` config variable.  This rule must exist.
          For **erasure** pools it is ``erasure-code`` if the ``default``
          `erasure code profile`_ is used or ``{pool-name}`` otherwise.  This
          rule will be created implicitly if it doesn't exist already.


``[erasure-code-profile=profile]``

.. _erasure code profile: ../erasure-code-profile

:Description: For **erasure** pools only. Use the `erasure code profile`_. It
              must be an existing profile as defined by
              **osd erasure-code-profile set**.

:Type: String
:Required: No.

``--autoscale-mode=<on,off,warn>``

:Description: Autoscale mode

:Type: String
:Required: No.
:Default:  The default behavior is controlled by the ``osd pool default pg autoscale mode`` option.

If you set the autoscale mode to ``on`` or ``warn``, you can let the system autotune or recommend changes to the number of placement groups in your pool based on actual usage.  If you leave it off, then you should refer to `Placement Groups`_ for more information.

.. _Placement Groups: ../placement-groups

``[expected-num-objects]``

:Description: The expected number of objects for this pool. By setting this value (
              together with a negative **filestore merge threshold**), the PG folder
              splitting would happen at the pool creation time, to avoid the latency
              impact to do a runtime folder splitting.

:Type: Integer
:Required: No.
:Default: 0, no splitting at the pool creation time.

.. _associate-pool-to-application:

Associate Pool to Application
=============================

Pools need to be associated with an application before use. Pools that will be
used with CephFS or pools that are automatically created by RGW are
automatically associated. Pools that are intended for use with RBD should be
initialized using the ``rbd`` tool (see `Block Device Commands`_ for more
information).

For other cases, you can manually associate a free-form application name to
a pool.::

        ceph osd pool application enable {pool-name} {application-name}

.. note:: CephFS uses the application name ``cephfs``, RBD uses the
   application name ``rbd``, and RGW uses the application name ``rgw``.

Set Pool Quotas
===============

You can set pool quotas for the maximum number of bytes and/or the maximum
number of objects per pool. ::

	ceph osd pool set-quota {pool-name} [max_objects {obj-count}] [max_bytes {bytes}]

For example::

	ceph osd pool set-quota data max_objects 10000

To remove a quota, set its value to ``0``.


Delete a Pool
=============

To delete a pool, execute::

	ceph osd pool delete {pool-name} [{pool-name} --yes-i-really-really-mean-it]


To remove a pool the mon_allow_pool_delete flag must be set to true in the Monitor's
configuration. Otherwise they will refuse to remove a pool.

See `Monitor Configuration`_ for more information.

.. _Monitor Configuration: ../../configuration/mon-config-ref

If you created your own rules for a pool you created, you should consider
removing them when you no longer need your pool::

	ceph osd pool get {pool-name} crush_rule

If the rule was "123", for example, you can check the other pools like so::

	ceph osd dump | grep "^pool" | grep "crush_rule 123"

If no other pools use that custom rule, then it's safe to delete that
rule from the cluster.

If you created users with permissions strictly for a pool that no longer
exists, you should consider deleting those users too::

	ceph auth ls | grep -C 5 {pool-name}
	ceph auth del {user}


Rename a Pool
=============

To rename a pool, execute::

	ceph osd pool rename {current-pool-name} {new-pool-name}

If you rename a pool and you have per-pool capabilities for an authenticated
user, you must update the user's capabilities (i.e., caps) with the new pool
name.

Show Pool Statistics
====================

To show a pool's utilization statistics, execute::

	rados df

Additionally, to obtain I/O information for a specific pool or all, execute::

        ceph osd pool stats [{pool-name}]


Make a Snapshot of a Pool
=========================

To make a snapshot of a pool, execute::

	ceph osd pool mksnap {pool-name} {snap-name}

Remove a Snapshot of a Pool
===========================

To remove a snapshot of a pool, execute::

	ceph osd pool rmsnap {pool-name} {snap-name}

.. _setpoolvalues:

Set the Number of Object Replicas
=================================

To set the number of object replicas on a replicated pool, execute the following::

	ceph osd pool set {poolname} size {num-replicas}

.. important:: The ``{num-replicas}`` includes the object itself.
   If you want the object and two copies of the object for a total of
   three instances of the object, specify ``3``.

For example::

	ceph osd pool set data size 3

You may execute this command for each pool. **Note:** An object might accept
I/Os in degraded mode with fewer than ``pool size`` replicas.  To set a minimum
number of required replicas for I/O, you should use the ``min_size`` setting.
For example::

  ceph osd pool set data min_size 2

This ensures that no object in the data pool will receive I/O with fewer than
``min_size`` replicas.


Get the Number of Object Replicas
=================================

To get the number of object replicas, execute the following::

	ceph osd dump | grep 'replicated size'

Ceph will list the pools, with the ``replicated size`` attribute highlighted.
By default, ceph creates two replicas of an object (a total of three copies, or
a size of 3).
