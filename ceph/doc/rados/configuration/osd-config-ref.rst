 OSD Config Reference
======================

.. index:: OSD; configuration

You can configure Ceph OSD Daemons in the Ceph configuration file (or in recent
releases, the central config store), but Ceph OSD
Daemons can use the default values and a very minimal configuration. A minimal
Ceph OSD Daemon configuration sets ``osd journal size`` (for Filestore), ``host``,  and
uses default values for nearly everything else.

Ceph OSD Daemons are numerically identified in incremental fashion, beginning
with ``0`` using the following convention. ::

	osd.0
	osd.1
	osd.2

In a configuration file, you may specify settings for all Ceph OSD Daemons in
the cluster by adding configuration settings to the ``[osd]`` section of your
configuration file. To add settings directly to a specific Ceph OSD Daemon
(e.g., ``host``), enter  it in an OSD-specific section of your configuration
file. For example:

.. code-block:: ini

	[osd]
		osd_journal_size = 5120

	[osd.0]
		host = osd-host-a

	[osd.1]
		host = osd-host-b


.. index:: OSD; config settings

General Settings
================

The following settings provide a Ceph OSD Daemon's ID, and determine paths to
data and journals. Ceph deployment scripts typically generate the UUID
automatically.

.. warning:: **DO NOT** change the default paths for data or journals, as it
             makes it more problematic to troubleshoot Ceph later.

When using Filestore, the journal size should be at least twice the product of the expected drive
speed multiplied by ``filestore_max_sync_interval``. However, the most common
practice is to partition the journal drive (often an SSD), and mount it such
that Ceph uses the entire partition for the journal.


``osd_uuid``

:Description: The universally unique identifier (UUID) for the Ceph OSD Daemon.
:Type: UUID
:Default: The UUID.
:Note: The ``osd_uuid`` applies to a single Ceph OSD Daemon. The ``fsid``
       applies to the entire cluster.


``osd_data``

:Description: The path to the OSDs data. You must create the directory when
              deploying Ceph. You should mount a drive for OSD data at this
              mount point. We do not recommend changing the default.

:Type: String
:Default: ``/var/lib/ceph/osd/$cluster-$id``


``osd_max_write_size``

:Description: The maximum size of a write in megabytes.
:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: ``90``


``osd_max_object_size``

:Description: The maximum size of a RADOS object in bytes.
:Type: 32-bit Unsigned Integer
:Default: 128MB


``osd_client_message_size_cap``

:Description: The largest client data message allowed in memory.
:Type: 64-bit Unsigned Integer
:Default: 500MB default. ``500*1024L*1024L``


``osd_class_dir``

:Description: The class path for RADOS class plug-ins.
:Type: String
:Default: ``$libdir/rados-classes``


.. index:: OSD; file system

File System Settings
====================
Ceph builds and mounts file systems which are used for Ceph OSDs.

``osd_mkfs_options {fs-type}``

:Description: Options used when creating a new Ceph Filestore OSD of type {fs-type}.

:Type: String
:Default for xfs: ``-f -i 2048``
:Default for other file systems: {empty string}

For example::
  ``osd_mkfs_options_xfs = -f -d agcount=24``

``osd_mount_options {fs-type}``

:Description: Options used when mounting a Ceph Filestore OSD of type {fs-type}.

:Type: String
:Default for xfs: ``rw,noatime,inode64``
:Default for other file systems: ``rw, noatime``

For example::
  ``osd_mount_options_xfs = rw, noatime, inode64, logbufs=8``


.. index:: OSD; journal settings

Journal Settings
================

This section applies only to the older Filestore OSD back end.  Since Luminous
BlueStore has been default and preferred.

By default, Ceph expects that you will provision a Ceph OSD Daemon's journal at
the following path, which is usually a symlink to a device or partition::

	/var/lib/ceph/osd/$cluster-$id/journal

When using a single device type (for example, spinning drives), the journals
should be *colocated*: the logical volume (or partition) should be in the same
device as the ``data`` logical volume.

When using a mix of fast (SSDs, NVMe) devices with slower ones (like spinning
drives) it makes sense to place the journal on the faster device, while
``data`` occupies the slower device fully.

The default ``osd_journal_size`` value is 5120 (5 gigabytes), but it can be
larger, in which case it will need to be set in the ``ceph.conf`` file.
A value of 10 gigabytes is common in practice::

	osd_journal_size = 10240


``osd_journal``

:Description: The path to the OSD's journal. This may be a path to a file or a
              block device (such as a partition of an SSD). If it is a file,
              you must create the directory to contain it. We recommend using a
              separate fast device when the ``osd_data`` drive is an HDD.

:Type: String
:Default: ``/var/lib/ceph/osd/$cluster-$id/journal``


``osd_journal_size``

:Description: The size of the journal in megabytes.

:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: ``5120``


See `Journal Config Reference`_ for additional details.


Monitor OSD Interaction
=======================

Ceph OSD Daemons check each other's heartbeats and report to monitors
periodically. Ceph can use default values in many cases. However, if your
network has latency issues, you may need to adopt longer intervals. See
`Configuring Monitor/OSD Interaction`_ for a detailed discussion of heartbeats.


Data Placement
==============

See `Pool & PG Config Reference`_ for details.


.. index:: OSD; scrubbing

.. _rados_config_scrubbing:

Scrubbing
=========

In addition to making multiple copies of objects, Ceph ensures data integrity by
scrubbing placement groups. Ceph scrubbing is analogous to ``fsck`` on the
object storage layer. For each placement group, Ceph generates a catalog of all
objects and compares each primary object and its replicas to ensure that no
objects are missing or mismatched. Light scrubbing (daily) checks the object
size and attributes.  Deep scrubbing (weekly) reads the data and uses checksums
to ensure data integrity.

Scrubbing is important for maintaining data integrity, but it can reduce
performance. You can adjust the following settings to increase or decrease
scrubbing operations.

              But a scrub will be performed
              no matter whether the time window allows or not, as long as the placement
              group's scrub interval exceeds ``osd_scrub_max_interval``.
:Type: Integer in the range of 0 to 23
:Default: ``0``

              Use ``osd_scrub_begin_hour = 0`` and ``osd_scrub_end_hour = 0`` to allow scrubbing
              for the entire day.  Along with ``osd_scrub_begin_hour``, they define a time
              window, in which the scrubs can happen. But a scrub will be performed
              no matter whether the time window allows or not, as long as the placement
              group's scrub interval exceeds ``osd_scrub_max_interval``.

              Along with ``osd_scrub_end_week_day``, they define a time window in which
              scrubs can happen. But a scrub will be performed
              no matter whether the time window allows or not, when the PG's

              no matter whether the time window allows or not, as long as the placement
              group's scrub interval exceeds ``osd_scrub_max_interval``.
:Type: Integer in the range of 0 to 6
:Default: ``0``


``osd scrub during recovery``

:Description: Allow scrub during recovery. Setting this to ``false`` will disable
              scheduling new scrub (and deep--scrub) while there is active recovery.
              Already running scrubs will be continued. This might be useful to reduce

``osd_scrub_chunk_min``

:Description: The minimal number of object store chunks to scrub during single operation.
              Ceph blocks writes to single chunk during scrub.

:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: 5


``osd_scrub_chunk_max``

:Description: The maximum number of object store chunks to scrub during single operation.

:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: 25


``osd_scrub_sleep``

:Description: Time to sleep before scrubbing the next group of chunks. Increasing this value will slow

:Type: Float
:Default: 0


``osd_deep_scrub_interval``

``osd_scrub_interval_randomize_ratio``

:Description: Add a random delay to ``osd_scrub_min_interval`` when scheduling
              the next scrub job for a PG. The delay is a random
              value less than ``osd_scrub_min_interval`` \*
              ``osd_scrub_interval_randomized_ratio``. The default setting
              spreads scrubs throughout the allowed time

``osd_scrub_auto_repair_num_errors``

:Description: Auto repair will not occur if more than this many errors are found.
:Type: 32-bit Integer

.. index:: OSD; operations settings

Operations
==========

 ``osd_op_queue``

:Description: This sets the type of queue to be used for prioritizing ops
              within each OSD. Both queues feature a strict sub-queue which is
              dequeued before the normal queue. The normal queue is different
              between implementations. The WeightedPriorityQueue (``wpq``)
              dequeues operations in relation to their priorities to prevent
              starvation of any queue. WPQ should help in cases where a few OSDs
              are more overloaded than others. The new mClockQueue
              (``mclock_scheduler``) prioritizes operations based on which class
              they belong to (recovery, scrub, snaptrim, client op, osd subop).
              See `QoS Based on mClock`_. Requires a restart.

:Type: String
:Valid Choices: wpq, mclock_scheduler
:Default: ``wpq``


``osd_op_queue_cut_off``

:Description: This selects which priority ops will be sent to the strict
              queue verses the normal queue. The ``low`` setting sends all
              replication ops and higher to the strict queue, while the ``high``
              option sends only replication acknowledgment ops and higher to
              the strict queue. Setting this to ``high`` should help when a few
              OSDs in the cluster are very busy especially when combined with
              ``wpq`` in the ``osd_op_queue`` setting. OSDs that are very busy
              handling replication traffic could starve primary client traffic
              on these OSDs without these settings. Requires a restart.

:Type: String
:Valid Choices: low, high
:Default: ``high``


``osd_client_op_priority``

:Description: The priority set for client operations.  This value is relative
              to that of ``osd_recovery_op_priority`` below.  The default
              strongly favors client ops over recovery.

:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: ``63``
:Valid Range: 1-63


``osd_recovery_op_priority``

:Description: The priority of recovery operations vs client operations, if not specified by the
              pool's ``recovery_op_priority``.  The default value prioritizes client
              ops (see above) over recovery ops.  You may adjust the tradeoff of client
              impact against the time to restore cluster health by lowering this value
              for increased prioritization of client ops, or by increasing it to favor
              recovery.

:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: ``3``
:Valid Range: 1-63


``osd_scrub_priority``

:Description: The default work queue priority for scheduled scrubs when the
              pool doesn't specify a value of ``scrub_priority``.  This can be
              boosted to the value of ``osd_client_op_priority`` when scrubs are
              blocking client operations.

:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: ``5``
:Valid Range: 1-63


``osd_requested_scrub_priority``

:Description: The priority set for user requested scrub on the work queue.  If
              this value were to be smaller than ``osd_client_op_priority`` it
              can be boosted to the value of ``osd_client_op_priority`` when
              scrub is blocking client operations.

:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: ``120``


``osd_snap_trim_priority``

:Description: The priority set for the snap trim work queue.

:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: ``5``
:Valid Range: 1-63

``osd_snap_trim_sleep``

:Description: Time in seconds to sleep before next snap trim op.
              Increasing this value will slow down snap trimming.
              This option overrides backend specific variants.

:Type: Float
:Default: ``0``


``osd_snap_trim_sleep_hdd``

:Description: Time in seconds to sleep before next snap trim op
              for HDDs.

:Type: Float
:Default: ``5``


``osd_snap_trim_sleep_ssd``

:Description: Time in seconds to sleep before next snap trim op
              for SSD OSDs (including NVMe).

:Type: Float
:Default: ``0``


``osd_snap_trim_sleep_hybrid``

:Description: Time in seconds to sleep before next snap trim op
              when OSD data is on an HDD and the OSD journal or WAL+DB is on an SSD.

:Type: Float
:Default: ``2``

:Description: How many operations logs to display at once.
:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: ``5``


.. _dmclock-qos:

QoS Based on mClock
-------------------

Ceph's use of mClock is now more refined and can be used by following the
steps as described in `mClock Config Reference`_.

Core Concepts
`````````````

Ceph's QoS support is implemented using a queueing scheduler
based on `the dmClock algorithm`_. This algorithm allocates the I/O
resources of the Ceph cluster in proportion to weights, and enforces
the constraints of minimum reservation and maximum limitation, so that
the services can compete for the resources fairly. Currently the
*mclock_scheduler* operation queue divides Ceph services involving I/O
resources into following buckets:

- client op: the iops issued by client
- osd subop: the iops issued by primary OSD
- snap trim: the snap trimming related requests
- pg recovery: the recovery related requests
- pg scrub: the scrub related requests

And the resources are partitioned using following three sets of tags. In other
words, the share of each type of service is controlled by three tags:

#. reservation: the minimum IOPS allocated for the service.
#. limitation: the maximum IOPS allocated for the service.
#. weight: the proportional share of capacity if extra capacity or system
   oversubscribed.

In Ceph, operations are graded with "cost". And the resources allocated
for serving various services are consumed by these "costs". So, for
example, the more reservation a services has, the more resource it is
guaranteed to possess, as long as it requires. Assuming there are 2
services: recovery and client ops:

- recovery: (r:1, l:5, w:1)
- client ops: (r:2, l:0, w:9)

The settings above ensure that the recovery won't get more than 5
requests per second serviced, even if it requires so (see CURRENT
IMPLEMENTATION NOTE below), and no other services are competing with
it. But if the clients start to issue large amount of I/O requests,
neither will they exhaust all the I/O resources. 1 request per second
is always allocated for recovery jobs as long as there are any such
requests. So the recovery jobs won't be starved even in a cluster with
high load. And in the meantime, the client ops can enjoy a larger
portion of the I/O resource, because its weight is "9", while its
competitor "1". In the case of client ops, it is not clamped by the
limit setting, so it can make use of all the resources if there is no
recovery ongoing.

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: the current implementation enforces the limit
values. Therefore, if a service crosses the enforced limit, the op remains
in the operation queue until the limit is restored.

Subtleties of mClock
````````````````````

The reservation and limit values have a unit of requests per
second. The weight, however, does not technically have a unit and the
weights are relative to one another. So if one class of requests has a
weight of 1 and another a weight of 9, then the latter class of
requests should get 9 executed at a 9 to 1 ratio as the first class.
However that will only happen once the reservations are met and those
values include the operations executed under the reservation phase.

Even though the weights do not have units, one must be careful in
choosing their values due how the algorithm assigns weight tags to
requests. If the weight is *W*, then for a given class of requests,
the next one that comes in will have a weight tag of *1/W* plus the
previous weight tag or the current time, whichever is larger. That
means if *W* is sufficiently large and therefore *1/W* is sufficiently
small, the calculated tag may never be assigned as it will get a value
of the current time. The ultimate lesson is that values for weight
should not be too large. They should be under the number of requests
one expects to be serviced each second.

Caveats
```````

There are some factors that can reduce the impact of the mClock op
queues within Ceph. First, requests to an OSD are sharded by their
placement group identifier. Each shard has its own mClock queue and
these queues neither interact nor share information among them. The
number of shards can be controlled with the configuration options
``osd_op_num_shards``, ``osd_op_num_shards_hdd``, and
``osd_op_num_shards_ssd``. A lower number of shards will increase the
impact of the mClock queues, but may have other deleterious effects.

Second, requests are transferred from the operation queue to the
operation sequencer, in which they go through the phases of
execution. The operation queue is where mClock resides and mClock
determines the next op to transfer to the operation sequencer. The
number of operations allowed in the operation sequencer is a complex
issue. In general we want to keep enough operations in the sequencer
so it's always getting work done on some operations while it's waiting
for disk and network access to complete on other operations. On the
other hand, once an operation is transferred to the operation
sequencer, mClock no longer has control over it. Therefore to maximize
the impact of mClock, we want to keep as few operations in the
operation sequencer as possible. So we have an inherent tension.

The configuration options that influence the number of operations in
the operation sequencer are ``bluestore_throttle_bytes``,
``bluestore_throttle_deferred_bytes``,
``bluestore_throttle_cost_per_io``,
``bluestore_throttle_cost_per_io_hdd``, and
``bluestore_throttle_cost_per_io_ssd``.

A third factor that affects the impact of the mClock algorithm is that
we're using a distributed system, where requests are made to multiple
OSDs and each OSD has (can have) multiple shards. Yet we're currently
using the mClock algorithm, which is not distributed (note: dmClock is
the distributed version of mClock).

Various organizations and individuals are currently experimenting with
mClock as it exists in this code base along with their modifications
to the code base. We hope you'll share you're experiences with your
mClock and dmClock experiments on the ``ceph-devel`` mailing list.

.. index:: OSD; backfilling

Backfilling
===========

When you add or remove Ceph OSD Daemons to a cluster, CRUSH will
rebalance the cluster by moving placement groups to or from Ceph OSDs
to restore balanced utilization. The process of migrating placement groups and
the objects they contain can reduce the cluster's operational performance
considerably. To maintain operational performance, Ceph performs this migration
with 'backfilling', which allows Ceph to set backfill operations to a lower
priority than requests to read or write data.

.. index:: OSD; osdmap

OSD Map
=======

OSD maps reflect the OSD daemons operating in the cluster. Over time, the
number of map epochs increases. Ceph provides some settings to ensure that
Ceph performs well as the OSD map grows larger.


``osd_map_dedup``

:Description: Enable removing duplicates in the OSD map.
:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``true``


``osd_map_cache_size``

:Description: The number of OSD maps to keep cached.
:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: ``50``


``osd_map_message_max``

:Description: The maximum map entries allowed per MOSDMap message.
:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: ``40``



.. index:: OSD; recovery

Recovery
========

When the cluster starts or when a Ceph OSD Daemon crashes and restarts, the OSD
begins peering with other Ceph OSD Daemons before writes can occur.  See
`Monitoring OSDs and PGs`_ for details.

If a Ceph OSD Daemon crashes and comes back online, usually it will be out of
sync with other Ceph OSD Daemons containing more recent versions of objects in
the placement groups. When this happens, the Ceph OSD Daemon goes into recovery
mode and seeks to get the latest copy of the data and bring its map back up to
date. Depending upon how long the Ceph OSD Daemon was down, the OSD's objects
and placement groups may be significantly out of date. Also, if a failure domain
went down (e.g., a rack), more than one Ceph OSD Daemon may come back online at
the same time. This can make the recovery process time consuming and resource
intensive.

To maintain operational performance, Ceph performs recovery with limitations on
the number recovery requests, threads and object chunk sizes which allows Ceph
perform well in a degraded state.


``osd_recovery_delay_start``

:Description: After peering completes, Ceph will delay for the specified number
              of seconds before starting to recover RADOS objects.

:Type: Float
:Default: ``0``


``osd_recovery_max_active``

:Description: The number of active recovery requests per OSD at one time. More
              requests will accelerate recovery, but the requests places an
              increased load on the cluster.

	      This value is only used if it is non-zero. Normally it
	      is ``0``, which means that the ``hdd`` or ``ssd`` values
	      (below) are used, depending on the type of the primary
	      device backing the OSD.

:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: ``0``

``osd_recovery_max_active_hdd``

:Description: The number of active recovery requests per OSD at one time, if the
	      primary device is rotational.

:Type: 32-bit Integer
:Default: ``3``

``osd_recovery_max_active_ssd``

:Description: The number of active recovery requests per OSD at one time, if the
	      primary device is non-rotational (i.e., an SSD).

              to ``true``.

:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``true``


``osd_recovery_sleep``

:Description: Time in seconds to sleep before the next recovery or backfill op.
              Increasing this value will slow down recovery operation while
              client operations will be less impacted.

:Type: Float
:Default: ``0``


``osd_recovery_sleep_hdd``

:Description: Time in seconds to sleep before next recovery or backfill op
              for HDDs.

:Default: ``0.1``


``osd_recovery_sleep_ssd``

:Description: Time in seconds to sleep before the next recovery or backfill op
              for SSDs.

:Type: Float
:Default: ``0``

              when OSD data is on HDD and OSD journal / WAL+DB is on SSD.

:Type: Float
:Default: ``0.025``


``osd_recovery_priority``

:Description: The default priority set for recovery work queue.  Not
              related to a pool's ``recovery_priority``.

:Type: 32-bit Integer
